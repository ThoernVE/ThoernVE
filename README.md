Welcome to My GitHub

I am a system development student specializing in .NET, with a background in both web development and backend programming. My studies have covered a wide range of topics, including databases, API development (both controllers and minimal APIs), system architecture, and design patterns. I am passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and continuously improving my skills.

In web development, I have experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for traditional websites, as well as utilizing Blazor to build modern web applications. On the backend, I have worked extensively with database management and API development, ensuring efficient and scalable solutions.

Beyond my studies, I enjoy working on side projects where I can experiment with new technologies and refine my development skills. In my free time, I also engage in training and gaming, maintaining a balance between work and personal interests.
